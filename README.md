# federated-learning-security

This repository will host mostly if not all the code used for this project either directly on here, or as [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).

## Table of Contents

- [Deep Leakage Example (from MIT's Han Lab)](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/dlg).

- [The Example I created as a test](https://github.com/harrysharma1/federated-learning-analysis).

- [Web application to highlight this research](https://github.com/harrysharma1/federated-learning-results).

__Features__:
- [x] Using [my tweaked DLG](https://github.com/harrysharma1/federated-learning-analysis) to showcase the effect of poor security on CIFAR Dataset.
- [x] Add a multiple range version, that will also showcase this.
- [x] Add randomise button for both single and multiple versions.
- [x] Showcase similarity with measures of Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), Mean Squar Error (MSE), and Peak Signal-To-Noise Ratio.

__TODO__:
- [ ] Add upload for personal image to test this out.
- [ ] Add text based version to showcase this.
- [ ] more to come...

- [Sentiment analysis using general ML method, may remove in the future but gave insipiration to add text based training showcase for DLG](https://github.com/harrysharma1/sentiment-analysis).
